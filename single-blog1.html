                     <h2>Class observation personal reflection
                     </h2>
                     <p class="excert">
                        The observation process is a great tool within the learning and teaching process. It is beneficial not just for the one who observes but the observed one. Even though the observation process and report of this must be objective, The Student – Teacher has the opportunity to reflect on the development of the class and relate this to their teaching practice with the only purpose to improve it and so education. With that said, the following reflection is based on my personal perception of the class development.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                       The first aspect that I would like to highlight is the organization of the class and how students were informed of the goals to achieve in the course of this. This allows to have a sequence and the relationship student – expectations/aims in the same page.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                         As it is well known a classroom is full with different events at the same time, which might affect fluency of the lesson. The observed classroom has a ‘Forced’ virtual context, due to the pandemic, where students after a week full of academic exercises and hours sit in a desk have to be awake and ready for class at 6:00 am, Most of them from second semester, which means they do not know their classmates.  I think this might be one of the reasons why in some occasions students were not that responsive to the Teacher commands.                         
                     </p>
                     <p>
                         Another aspect that is important to mention is how the assessment was given and received. There is a contrast between the first and second presentations class. In the first one, besides of giving the words to work on in terms of pronunciation, the teacher asked students some questions about their presentation as a way to reinforce the students’ knowledge on the matter and correct them if necessary. In the second one, due to the lack of time left, the teacher just corrected the mispronunciations. This might affect negatively the retention of the students in the topic and make difficult to see if they actually achieved the aims. 

                     </p>
                     <p>
                         It is also worth noting that students tended to repeat the same mistakes as their classmates even though the assessment was for everybody in class. Which leads to believe that students are more worried about their performance than others while evaluating. I suggest those ´feedback words and expressions’ are used in the next activities so they can see them in real context and learn them by experience.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                         There were long period of silent among activities, in most cases due to some problem related to the virtually aspects, the platform can serve as example. However, when the class is in a practice environment, students are open to participate and be corrected, especially in activities were they can work as a group, to be specific the ‘Guess their favorite places’ activity, students were actively involved and sounded excited on working in the activity that mix their likes and required goals in the lesson, in my opinion, a total success. The ‘new normally’ has given educators a bigger challenge and being able to perceive the effort that is put into a lesson in order to make it meaningful is really valuable.
