                <h3> <strong>Listening</strong></h3> <br>

                <h4><strong>1: Have you ever had difficulties understanding audios or listening activities?</strong></h4>
                <p class="excert">
                  I actually have many times specially in French class. For me it’s difficult because I can understand when my professors talk to me but It’s harder when I see a video or a listen to an audio. I think it might be because I don’t have enough exposure to the language.    
              </p>
              <h4><strong>2: What other strategy or activity do you think can help improve the listening skill? </strong></h4>
              <p>
               Well something that helped me a lot to improve my Listening skill in English was listening to Shawn Mendes’ interviews. He’s my favorite artist so I was super motivated, as he travels around the world I could hear different accents from what I was used to. I also found a YouTube channel that became my favorite so I get so much more input from that. My piece of advice would be try to look for something that you really enjoy so you’ll feel motivated to improve.  
           </p>
           <h4><strong>3: Based on the presentation, why do you think listening is important?</strong></h4>
           <p>
            I think it is important because is the ability that opens the path for the rest ones. It’s the one that shows me in many cases the patterns of the language and the context where it’s been used. Can be even the first contact with the target language and a channel to be acquired.                          
        </p>
        <h4><strong>4: Do you think that following pre-listening, listening and post-listening sequence should be implemented more? Why?</strong></h4>
        <p>
         I do, because doing listening activities can be frustrating for students. With this sequence we prepare students and give them tools for the moment they run into contact with the language besides, students can also use those tools to have an active role and interact. 

     </p>
     <h3> <strong>Vocabulary</strong></h3> <br>
     <h4><strong>1: As a learner of a second foreign language, what strategies do you use to learn vocabulary? Which is more successful? Less successful?</strong></h4>
     <p>
         When I had to learn a long list of vocabulary what I used to do at the beginning was to write down the words and repeat them till I memorized them but this was not successful, then what I tried to do was classify each word in a type or characteristic and a color, this was useful but the best way that I found was seeing real life examples where I could understand the context and use of the target word. 
     </p>
          <h4><strong>2: As a teacher, are you more concerned about the quality? How will you divide your reaching time between teaching words and teaching word learning strategies?</strong></h4>
     <p>
         In my short experience as an autonomous English teacher I have designed more time to practice speaking skills than teaching a set of isolated words, I like to provide materials that my students can use to gather real word information so what they learn can be actually used in a meaningful way, I honestly had never thought about teaching word learning strategies before but I will definitely use them in the future.   
     </p>


     <h3> <strong>Reading</strong></h3> <br>
     <h4><strong>1: What does it mean to be an engaged reader?</strong></h4>
     <p>
         For me being an engaged reader can have two connotations the first one is about the time dedicated to read, this means that reading is a habit in the person’s life; and the second one, which is my favorite, is being able to focus completely on the reading, not just to understand what is being said but to relate the content to the experiences had and reflect about it.  
     </p>
          <h4><strong>2: What can teacher do to help learners become engaged readers?</strong></h4>
     <p>
         I have always said that reading is not that hard when you read about something you like, I think teachers sometimes mistake when they give students a long reading about something that is not relevant for the students, this causes that students feel demotivated and they even can just not to do the assignment. My piece of advice is to take into consideration students’ likes age and topics that are meaningful to them in order to first get them involved in the field and then reflect and discuss about it with their classmates.    
     </p>

     <h3> <strong>Writing</strong></h3> <br>
     <h4><strong>1: Gene Fowler said: "Writing is easy:  All you do is sit staring at a blank sheet of paper until drops of blood form on your forehead." What does he mean? Do you think writing is like this?</strong></h4>
     <p>
         I think that what Gene tried to say is that writing is to transform your deepest thoughts into a physic form for others to interpret, I do think that writing is like this but not always, it deepens on the matter that’s been told, the purpose and the audience whom we are directing our speech. Besides it each author gives a little bit of their persona while writing, another view of Gene’s point. 
     </p>
          <h4><strong>2: How important do you think writing in English is in today’s world?</strong></h4>
     <p>
        I think sometimes writing is underestimated in rushed daily life but, I believe It is important because it is the way in which our legacy is spread through generations. Thanks to this we have information, useful to solve problems or even pose questions never asked before, and we are able to keep much more information in whatever field we are interested in. I think that a teacher must also not just grammar to form sentences but write and teach to write with purpose.
